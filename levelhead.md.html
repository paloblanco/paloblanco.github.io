                        **All about LevelHead**

Below is a series of tweets i wrote up about Levelhead, a video game about playing and making platformer levels. It's excellent, and the creators of the game, Butterscotch Shenanigans, have a strong web presence, including a blog and podcast about running a small software business. All great stuff, and I highly recommend checking them out: https://www.bscotch.net/

Start the tweets!

I usually use my pinned tweet to show off my latest project, but I really need to talk about just how good #levelhead is, by @BScotchShenani . I'm just gonna point out a few things that appeal to me so much, as a #gamedev hobbyist.

1. Sharing levels uses a "karma" system, a la #ldjam. You play more of other people's levels, and yours get played more. You can track stats! Two of my levels have hundreds of plays already, which is great for feedback as a level designer.

2. The level editor itself offers a HUGE amount of control, via its switch system. Camera controls, triggers, events, it can all be programmed. It is seriously more of a platformer-GAME maker, not just a level maker.

3. The online features just WORK. The community is generally pushing out high quality (though hard!) levels, and it is easy to filter for level types you want to play.

4. The game itself gets all of the little details right. Coyote jumps, sticky friction - it's all done just right. Presentation is also top notch, and hilarious. I would watch a television series of commerials for #levelhead.

5. Want to hear some very smart people talk about #gamedev? The whole community led by @BScotchShenani is a gem i wish I had found earlier. I suggest starting with their podcast for great discussion on #gamedev and professional development.

6. That's it! #Levelhead is on almost every platform (PC, android, IOS, Switch, XBOX), AND has cross save. If you want to get more into level design and learn more about gamedev, check these guys out.

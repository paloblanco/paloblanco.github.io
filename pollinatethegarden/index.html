                    **Pollinate the Garden**
                    *entered in ludum dare 46*

[Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) is a (now) biannual game jam in which thousands of participants submit games they have spent a single weekend developing. In April 2020, for Ludum Dare 46, I submitted "Pollinate the Garden," a game where you play as a bee which needs to pollinate the flowers in a garden.

It is a pretty unremarkable game. However, I am really trying to learn to make games with [threejs](https://threejs.org/), a javascript library which makes it fairly easy to draw 3d graphics to canvas using webgl. 

If somebody asked me for advice on how to make 3d games, I would probably tell them "go learn Unity." However, I personally really enjoy the activity of banging out code in a text editor, and unity is really more of a GUI-driven development environment. I see threejs as being my only accessible option for developing performant 3d games. It has the obvious bonus of being a web technology, meaning users don't actually need to download an executable to play any games I create with it. This is a colossal advantage - my own web games typically get at least 100x more engagement than anything that needs a download, and this is also something I observe during game jams.

So, while "Pollinate the Garden" has been submitted already, I hope to continue working on it to learn a few things. I plan to document them here.

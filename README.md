# Rocco's website

This is a repo I will be using for my website. I am following the directions from (https://rsip22.github.io/blog/create-a-blog-with-pelican-and-github-pages.html). 

## Some notes on files:
**header.txt**: This contains the header info which needs to appear on your content pages in markdown. I can't believe this doesn't autopopulate in some way.

Welcome to my homepage. This is where I will be keeping some information about myself, projects I am working on, and my interests.

Most of my online persona is via Palo Blanco Games, under which I make mostly retro-styled arcade games.

In my professional life, I am a data scientist at BGI, where I primarily work on aiding the US Navy by analyzing data related to fleet readiness.


Projects:
===============================================================================
1. List some games
2. [Learning threejs via ludum dare 46: Pollinate the Garden.](pollinatethegarden/index.html)
